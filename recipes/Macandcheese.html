        <li>1 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            
        <li>2 eggs, well beaten</li>
            
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>

        <li><h2>step 3:</h2> Whisk evaporated milk and eggs together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture. </li>
        <li><h2>step 4:</h2> Whisk milk and condensed soup together in a bowl until smooth; stir into pasta mixture.</li>
        <li><h2>step 5:</h2> Sprinkle remaining cheese over pasta mixture; garnish with paprika.</li>
        <li><h2>step 6:</h2> Cook on Low for 3 hours.</li>
        <li><h2>step 7:</h2> Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>TIPS:</h3>
    <p>Some slow cookers take less time. Check the edges are not getting too brown after 2 1/2 hours.</p>

    <p>To bake in a conventional oven, pour pasta mixture into a casserole dish and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
